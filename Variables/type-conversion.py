# Type is built in function. We pass an object as a argument and it returns its type
# print(type(x)) # === The answert is string

# Built in Changeing type Values in Python
# int(x)
# bool(x)
# str(x)
# float(x)

# Bool return falsy or truthy values
# Falsy are: (These are just false, Everything else is true)
